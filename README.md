Ahadu Sentri-AI OpenEDR automation system 

Ahadu SentriAI is an open-source cybersecurity project designed to provide intelligent Endpoint Detection and Response (EDR) capabilities. It leverages machine learning, rules-based policies, and automated actions to detect, analyze, and respond to security threats in real time.

Features
* Event Ingestion – Collects raw security events from endpoints.
* Feature Extraction – Transforms raw data into meaningful features for analysis.
* ML-Based Detection – Uses trained models to identify anomalies or malicious patterns.
* Policy Engine – Applies security rules for decision-making.
* Automated Response – Supports actions such as notify, quarantine, or isolate endpoints.
* Modular Design – Easy to extend with new features, models, or integrations.

Requirements

* Python 3.9+
* FastAPI
* scikit-learn (or your ML framework)
* Uvicorn
