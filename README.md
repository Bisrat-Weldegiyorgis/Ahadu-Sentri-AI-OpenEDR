# 🛡️ Unified Network Defense System (UNDS)

> A powerful all-in-one cybersecurity framework combining **Network Access Control (NAC)**, an **Automated Vulnerability Scanner**, and a real-time **Intrusion Prevention System (IPS)** — built to **scan**, **detect**, **report**, and **respond**.

---

## 🔍 What is UNDS?

UNDS is a modular, Python-powered cybersecurity project that:
- Controls which devices are allowed to connect to a network (NAC)
- Continuously scans for known vulnerabilities (Vulnerability Scanner)
- Detects and blocks malicious behavior in real time (IPS)

Together, these systems work to **secure internal networks**, **identify risks**, and **respond automatically** to threats.

## ⚙️ Key Features

### ✅ Network Access Control (NAC)
- Device whitelist/blacklist based on MAC/IP address
- Authentication rules for new devices
- Auto-blocks unauthorized devices

### 🔎 Automated Vulnerability Scanner
- Regular scanning of network hosts
- Checks for open ports, outdated services, weak configurations
- Generates detailed vulnerability reports (CVSS-based)

### 🔥 Intrusion Prevention System (IPS)
- Monitors network packets in real-time
- Detects suspicious traffic patterns and known signatures
- Blocks attacks such as:
  - Port scanning
  - ARP spoofing
  - DNS hijacking
  - Brute-force attempts
